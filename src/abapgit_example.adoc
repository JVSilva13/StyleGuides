== Example abapGit Setup

// todo, adjust the URL, the repo will be transferred to the abapGit organization,

There are lots of ways to setup code reviews, this section introduces a simple implementation of the <<One Way Synchronization from ABAP to Git>>, with commits for each task release, the example can be extended according to the needs of each organization.

A sample abapGit setup is provided at link:https://github.com/larshp/abapgit-review-example[https://github.com/larshp/abapgit-review-example], it can be installed via abapGit.

// todo, how much to describe here vs the repo?

For the release of each task, the following steps are performed:

. Determine the corresponding abapGit repository
. Create branch if not exists
. Push changes to branch
. Create PR if not exits

For release of request,

. Check PR is released, if not the request cannot be released

// What happens if the PR is released but user wants to deliberately add further tasks (or accidentally does so)? see https://github.com/larshp/abapgit-review-example/issues/12

// todo, verify
abapGit works on object level(R3TR), while the transport system works on subobject level(LIMU), if mirroring transports to git and subobjects exists in multiple transports, the abapGit based example will give an error.

// todo, verify
Transports must consistently match the git repositories, an error will be issued if a transport contains objects from multiple git repositories.
